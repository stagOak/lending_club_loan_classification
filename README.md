# lending_club_loan_classification
A lending club data set is divided into current, fully_paid and charged_off. Machine learning is used to map pre origination loan features to fully_paid or charged_off. Predictions are made on a validation set. Classification probability threshold is explored to understand the relationship between profitability and loan interest rate.
